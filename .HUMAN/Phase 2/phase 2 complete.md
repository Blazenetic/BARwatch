Phase 2 implementation is now complete! I've successfully added comprehensive data collection capabilities to the BAR Live Data Export Widget. Here's what has been implemented:

## âœ… Phase 2 Complete: Data Collection

### Key Features Added:

1. **Data Collection Scheduler** - Configurable frequency (default: every 10 frames / ~3 Hz)
2. **Game Information Collection** - Static data cached for performance (map, mod, version info)
3. **Time Information** - Frame numbers, game seconds, pause state, game speed
4. **Team/Player Data** - Economic resources (metal/energy), team status, alliances
5. **Unit Data Collection** - Positions, health, visibility checks, configurable detail levels
6. **Fog of War Compliance** - Only collects visible units, respects spectator mode
7. **Performance Monitoring** - Tracks collection time, warns on slow operations
8. **Configurable Granularity** - Minimal, Standard, Detailed levels
9. **Console Commands** - Extended debugging commands for data collection

### Data Structure:
The widget now collects structured game state data including:
- Schema version and timestamp
- Game metadata (map, mod, etc.)
- Time information (frames, seconds, pause state)
- Team economic data (resources, income, etc.)
- Visible unit data (positions, health, velocities, states)

### Performance Optimizations:
- API call minimization with caching
- Visibility checks before detailed collection
- Configurable unit limits (default: 500 max)
- Frame-based scheduling to avoid overwhelming the game loop
- Memory reuse and proper cleanup

### Configuration Options:
- Data collection enable/disable
- Collection frequency (frames)
- Granularity level (minimal/standard/detailed)
- Maximum units to process

### Integration with Phase 1:
- Data collection only runs when connected
- Performance monitoring combined with socket operations
- Unified configuration system
- Extended console commands for debugging

The widget is now ready for Phase 3 (JSON serialization and transmission). The data collection pipeline is robust, respects game rules, and maintains performance under the 2ms target. All major game state categories are collected with proper visibility handling and configurable detail levels.
