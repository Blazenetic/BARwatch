## Implementation Components

### 1. Performance Optimization

**Profiling Framework**:

#### Timing Infrastructure
```lua
-- Create a profiling system to measure each component
profiler = {
    collection = {time = 0, calls = 0},
    serialization = {time = 0, calls = 0},
    transmission = {time = 0, calls = 0},
    ui = {time = 0, calls = 0}
}
```

#### Measurement Points
- Data collection per category
- JSON encoding time
- Socket operations
- UI updates
- Memory allocations

- Edge cases will happen in production
- User feedback is invaluable
- Iterate based on real-world usage
- Plan for success - scalability matters

Remember: Phase 5 transforms a working prototype into a production-ready tool that the community can rely on. This phase is about polish, reliability, and sustainability. The extra effort spent here determines whether the widget becomes a trusted part of the BAR ecosystem or remains an experimental tool. Focus on quality, testing, and user experience refinement to ensure the widget meets professional standards and serves the community effectively for years to come.
